 So let's kind of work on trade with some I do. Welcome back 29 months. I'm a transfer to TDA of your recommendation says they're all the prices are 15 minutes behind why is that you can change that.,2277.0,2286.0,0.00018148812523577362,0.0,-0.24131554194859095,1.6812865497076024
 That's just like I think what they have on the default. There's a way you can change it. Look up on YouTube video on excited and it's like instant nail.,2286.0,2293.0,0.00018148812523577362,0.0,-0.24131554194859095,1.6812865497076024
 Okay. How you going to power the quarry. It has three power inputs. Flux. I do one K. You're right. That's actually a really good point. Right. Technically I can only do 3000 RFN. Now here here's the main thing. That doesn't matter.,2293.0,2306.0,0.0004427156818564981,0.0,-0.27239046258441474,1.7362637362637363
 Honestly 3000 RF is basically three four so the speed. It will run at three four so speed and that will be fast when I can handle. But technically what I can do is output this to a series of batteries and then output those batteries to this.,2306.0,2318.0,0.0004427156818564981,0.0,-0.27239046258441474,1.7362637362637363
 So I can do two inputs per battery. When I say battery I make capacitor which is it go over here. So I can have two wires come into here for 2000 RF a tick.,2318.0,2330.0,0.00014226183702703565,0.0,-0.2031684398651123,1.5357142857142858
 I guess however many I need and then just multiply it out. That's what I'm thinking. So I can do four in and three out and when I say three out.,2330.0,2343.0,0.00014226183702703565,0.0,-0.2031684398651123,1.5357142857142858
 Actually I can probably just use one capacitor do four connections in with the actual flux ducks and then just use a single actual NV connector.,2343.0,2352.0,9.84338330454193e-05,0.0,-0.2587073077894237,1.675392670157068
 And NV connectors I believe can do actually. NV connectors only to 2000 don't they. So I can use to I can do four in and two out and technically there's enough sides for that.,2352.0,2361.0,9.84338330454193e-05,0.0,-0.2587073077894237,1.675392670157068
 And I can essentially turn a you know the three connections into 4000 RF a tick. Either way it doesn't really matter like it's that's not really something I need to worry about because it's a really simple fix also in the future when we get power upgrades which will be good in towards capacitors to we'll get upgraded flux ducks and it won't matter.,2361.0,2377.0,1.7034813936334103e-05,0.0,-0.14722626025860125,1.5350877192982457
 Honestly I'm totally cool because these running at three four three four speed yeah three quarter speed so I think it's all right. I think you're losing a lot of RF and if the ducks only input one K connection if you're inputting 30 slow panels yes so here's,2377.0,2392.0,8.937717939261347e-05,0.0,-0.2560703913370768,1.5176470588235293
 a solution for that right during the day I can just bypass the actual capacity back the capacitor bank and I can just use or even during the night because they technically have internal storage as well I can just bypass this right here.,2392.0,2404.0,0.00010117718193214387,0.0,-0.1731129913330078,1.9326599326599327
 So if I just get three more of these we just go around and then you know we have basically the full bandwidth because he's not going to fry and we can use it all you know the whole time during the night time we can only use as many capacitors we have times a thousand or if we connect to them times 2000 or whatever you want to do right.,2404.0,2421.0,0.00010117718193214387,0.0,-0.1731129913330078,1.9326599326599327
 What my goal is today and I think I even talk about it is bats yeah so I want to make a wall of these and this does 1000 RF out those each to 300 or 250 ish RF predict in so basically for every solar panel I need every four solar panels I need one of these.,2421.0,2440.0,9.496347774984315e-05,0.0,-0.17268683016300201,1.5029239766081872
 And my goal I guess today I don't know if I can do today I probably can't and this is actually all explain why we're working on this but I want to make 30 capacitors so we can do 30 K RF in 30 K RF out and then I could just bypass this during the day as well.,2440.0,2458.0,0.00012992389383725822,0.0,-0.14615868119632497,1.48
 And then eventually we can set this up to be kind of even a larger system like 100 100 I don't really know it doesn't really matter either way the reason I want to do this whole thing to begin with the pump jacks the refineries stuff like that is because I need more sulfuric acid to make more batteries to make more flux docs to make more capacitors the whole it's all the whole systems integrated like it kind of like wraps back into itself.,2458.0,2477.0,0.0002140371798304841,0.0,-0.13177618459493173,1.8475177304964538
 So if I want to make it larger I need to like make the system better anyways.,2477.0,2481.0,0.0002140371798304841,0.0,-0.13177618459493173,1.8475177304964538
 And to do that I need to replace this shit this is like the kind of like the last part of the old base we got rid of the old green potion which I'm going to need to fix today as well and redo but this is an old oil refinery I want to make a new one that works like 10 times faster which means I need 10 times the amount of oil coming in as well which means we need pump jacks to so yeah I need I basically need to do more band I need to make more power.,2481.0,2510.0,0.00020250893430784345,0.0,-0.10462910045276988,1.8489795918367347
 Get more bandwidth and then once that's done then work on getting more things to be able to make more power more bandwidth easier so it kind of like leads back into itself which is cool and it's basically a.,2510.0,2521.0,6.125396612333134e-05,0.0,-0.16242896561074047,1.8823529411764706
 A positive feedback loop it's way more than 10 times faster can actually excited but it makes a positive feedback loop right now we can only make like I don't know something like let's say a hundred flux ducks an hour this makes like you know 10 thousand flux ducks an hour it's like it's way way faster.,2521.0,2538.0,6.125396612333134e-05,0.0,-0.16242896561074047,1.8823529411764706
 So and then you know with that we can just expand quicker and all that stuff to.,2538.0,2543.0,0.00011424287367844954,0.0,-0.1210281002906061,1.9004524886877827
 So that's important so I think the first thing we should do is redo the green potion system now that we have more flux ducks and we have more pipes and everything as well I think it's important that we redo the green potion system the red potion systems working great it shows zero right here but over here you can see it's something like.,2543.0,2564.0,0.00011424287367844954,0.0,-0.1210281002906061,1.9004524886877827
 Yeah we have like 1600 red research so it's ridiculous right green research is super locking and if we want to do like any research today which will need to.,2564.0,2574.0,0.0006572253769263625,0.0,-0.18111901610862208,1.7635782747603834

 So that's my current goal fully powered kind of a P. Yeah and I think we can probably afford the power to right I guess also we're making more solar panels and everything as well so it will be should be kind of nice so we're going to start with green potions and then after that we'll work on every.,2579.0,2593.0,0.0006572253769263625,0.0,-0.18111901610862208,1.7635782747603834

 Try to remind me so I can kind of like fit it in this list wherever it belongs this one does not need to be done immediately like I kind of want to work on other stuff while we're waiting on that to produce but this is my one of my big goals today so I guess we'll see I don't know.,2600.0,2615.0,0.0002370326401432976,0.0,-0.11779583716879086,1.7033898305084745

 Because like once we're able to like automate making more power oh my god dude we kind of this is kind of automating make more power but yeah like once like it's once we actually get unlimited income income of resources which is basically when this list is done.,2623.0,2637.0,0.0002111531066475436,0.0,-0.14183841213103263,1.8162393162393162

 circuits and I forget right like circuits I have to craft I think I just used a basic assembler no I didn't,3533.52,3540.52,5.988870907458477e-05,0.0,-0.21133051978217232,1.606060606060606
 wait shit okay standard assembler advanced duplicator and recycler so I think we should do standard,3540.52,3549.52,0.0001551605382701382,0.0,-0.21763523970500076,1.8995433789954337
 assembler and to make these I think I used to make the actual wires I kind of want to use another,3549.52,3556.52,0.0001551605382701382,0.0,-0.21763523970500076,1.8995433789954337
 standard assembler even though it's not as efficient cheese flake what's up I do thanks for the prime man,3556.52,3560.52,0.0001551605382701382,0.0,-0.21763523970500076,1.8995433789954337
 I want to use a lay that I just can't afford a lay right now this is also super fast so more standard assemblers,3560.52,3567.52,0.0001551605382701382,0.0,-0.21763523970500076,1.8995433789954337
 okay so let's see if we can start this,3567.52,3574.52,2.8323076548986137e-05,0.0,-0.23552164350237165,1.4252873563218391
 yeah okay tiny input hatch I'm going to need this this this this this this and that's,3586.52,3596.52,2.8323076548986137e-05,0.0,-0.23552164350237165,1.4252873563218391
 I need blocks of iron as well interesting,3596.52,3601.52,6.200766074471176e-05,0.0,-0.256622058589284,1.4774774774774775
 should I put it right here so we move it I think we should move it a little bit so we're going to need more space,3601.52,3629.52,5.599690121016465e-05,0.0,-0.21584792137145997,1.2988505747126438
 I think that'll work okay and then from here I need to go into the final assembler which is going,3632.52,3641.52,0.02745223604142666,0.0,-0.272591832858413,1.6235294117647059
 to make the actual green potion right so this is another basic assembler is no standard assembler I need,3641.52,3649.52,0.02745223604142666,0.0,-0.272591832858413,1.6235294117647059
 steel sheet metal and insert it okay inserters where's all my insiders at,3649.52,3655.52,0.02745223604142666,0.0,-0.272591832858413,1.6235294117647059
 there you'll get a few maybe I used them,3655.52,3662.52,1.8725657355389558e-05,0.0,-0.31122210290696883,1.3363636363636364
 insiders bug,3662.52,3670.52,1.8725657355389558e-05,0.0,-0.31122210290696883,1.3363636363636364
 another temporary permanent structure no this is the this is the actual green potion facility,3670.52,3681.52,1.8725657355389558e-05,0.0,-0.31122210290696883,1.3363636363636364
 like I'm going to make red potions here making green potions here there's nothing,3681.52,3685.52,0.0001387917873216793,0.0,-0.11968147361671531,1.8125
 temporary about this this is probably going to stay here for the until we need to like amp,3685.52,3689.52,0.0001387917873216793,0.0,-0.11968147361671531,1.8125
 up the green potion production which I'm not sure will ever need to it mainly is going to be,3689.52,3693.02,0.0001387917873216793,0.0,-0.11968147361671531,1.8125
 amping up the other ones which are so much harder I would say they're probably twice as,3693.02,3698.52,0.0001387917873216793,0.0,-0.11968147361671531,1.8125
 hard possibly even more,3698.52,3710.52,0.0001387917873216793,0.0,-0.11968147361671531,1.8125
 okay hold on I'm fucking this up hack what's up my man,3710.52,3718.52,0.00040429222281090915,0.0,-0.34873113632202146,1.146067415730337
 welcome I do for 28 welcome my baby got them it I think that's good right there,3718.52,3742.52,5.351421350496821e-05,0.0,-0.20057179207025572,1.4067796610169492
 the problem is we need inputs from over here that's going to be hard to grab right now,3742.52,3746.52,5.351421350496821e-05,0.0,-0.20057179207025572,1.4067796610169492
 for green potion we need three things oh no actually not really so this would be fine,3746.52,3751.52,0.00012053448881488293,0.0,-0.23559394635652242,1.7348484848484849
 so we need to input here and input here this input we don't need this impulse day,3751.52,3754.52,0.00012053448881488293,0.0,-0.23559394635652242,1.7348484848484849
 but we do need to actually break these the wise it won't work,3754.52,3760.52,0.00012053448881488293,0.0,-0.23559394635652242,1.7348484848484849
 monga okay input other input their output all right so charge this,3760.52,3778.52,1.6583371689193882e-05,0.0,-0.7321842417997473,1.0476190476190477
 just trying to think right now so we need for green potions insiders and conveyor belts,3790.52,3799.52,0.08381334692239761,0.0,-0.1969968132350756,1.759493670886076
 conveyor belts require an assembler iron ingots and iron gear iron gear I can make,3799.52,3806.52,0.08381334692239761,0.0,-0.1969968132350756,1.759493670886076
 it a stand of assemblers well so iron ingot and iron gear that means I can technically do one more of these,3806.52,3816.52,0.08381334692239761,0.0,-0.1969968132350756,1.759493670886076
 we make iron gears there iron ingots there so iron ingots going to both of these essentially,3816.52,3823.52,3.390524580026977e-05,0.0,-0.17574061518130096,1.8191489361702127
 and it's kind of close to this over here but I think it should be fine,3823.52,3830.52,3.390524580026977e-05,0.0,-0.17574061518130096,1.8191489361702127
 oh let's see here so from here let me I kind of want to set this up however it needs to be pipes,3830.52,3840.52,3.390524580026977e-05,0.0,-0.17574061518130096,1.8191489361702127
 do I have any pipes I'm going to need a ton of servos we're going to need routers,3840.52,3844.52,3.390524580026977e-05,0.0,-0.17574061518130096,1.8191489361702127
 oh god we gotta make so much shit how many pipes do we have or item ducts sorry,3844.52,3853.52,4.0593629819341004e-05,0.0,-0.18594127087979703,1.6101694915254237
 we have over a stack that's perfect I got I want to have to not touch this I want just to work nicely,3853.52,3861.52,4.0593629819341004e-05,0.0,-0.18594127087979703,1.6101694915254237
 so this will connect here I'm going to need to break this I didn't know it before things just get wacky,3861.52,3875.52,1.4013556210556999e-05,0.0,-0.14670780726841517,1.1573033707865168
 okay that should be good same thing over here,3875.52,3892.52,3.184492015861906e-05,0.0,-0.2353070882650522,0.8653846153846154
 okay alright so this should actually work really well because if I just get a bin,3892.52,3916.52,3.07930531562306e-05,0.0,-0.20122201442718507,1.1095890410958904
 let's just get this bin if I put this bin over here and I tell this bin you know hey this is going to be for iron ingots,3916.52,3923.52,3.9400219975505024e-05,0.0,-0.0995900941931683,1.9106382978723404
 and we put iron ingots in here this is going to make a gear right I got to get a metal press let me actually just get that right now,3923.52,3932.52,3.9400219975505024e-05,0.0,-0.0995900941931683,1.9106382978723404
 is it wise I have a stock of plates and gears like you have a certain amount of each bin,3932.52,3936.52,3.9400219975505024e-05,0.0,-0.0995900941931683,1.9106382978723404
 not really I think I just want to make this so the entire thing just works and then I just put it in input,3936.52,3941.52,3.9400219975505024e-05,0.0,-0.0995900941931683,1.9106382978723404
 unless there's one step that's extremely slow but I don't think that's really necessary because in the end if I have a constant flow of resources coming in it really shouldn't matter,3941.52,3949.52,2.379925899731461e-05,0.0,-0.08314973831176758,1.8228346456692914
 there might be a point where I need to make like multiple gear machines or something but it might even be smarter to make like a master bus,3949.52,3957.52,2.379925899731461e-05,0.0,-0.08314973831176758,1.8228346456692914
 where instead of having like you know if I need like four gear machines instead of actually doing that in line I just do that somewhere else,3957.52,3964.52,2.379925899731461e-05,0.0,-0.08314973831176758,1.8228346456692914
 and I just like import them in the way so I guess we'll see I need gear how do I make a gear mold,3964.52,3975.52,2.2863690901431255e-05,0.0,-0.3329192101955414,1.186046511627907
 okay,3975.52,3979.52,2.2863690901431255e-05,0.0,-0.3329192101955414,1.186046511627907
 stockpiles yeah they're nice for smoothing stuff out if you have like in it instable input but like it doesn't really matter again,3979.52,3995.52,3.2771993573987857e-05,0.0,-0.14477593971021246,1.5314285714285714
 green is not the potion we really need to like optimize 100% that's going to be probably blue I think blue is going to be the hardest one,3995.52,4003.52,3.2771993573987857e-05,0.0,-0.14477593971021246,1.5314285714285714
 so this will go in here and then this is going to put basically it four ingots into this which will make us an iron gear,4003.52,4013.52,2.182017487939447e-05,0.0,-0.09660777639835438,1.97979797979798
 iron gear will come out of here into this and that is going to combine with another iron ingot because it's in the same exact thing,4013.52,4021.52,2.182017487939447e-05,0.0,-0.09660777639835438,1.97979797979798
 and then if you take iron ingots to them and iron gear you get conveyor belts and then conveyor belts will go into the final step over here,4021.52,4029.52,2.182017487939447e-05,0.0,-0.09660777639835438,1.97979797979798
 so basically yeah pipe directly from shipping container into a machine and could do something like that right my goal is to do something like that but I need I don't want to do that until I actually have automated inputs,4029.52,4040.52,3.6091587389819324e-05,0.0,-0.13770429019270272,1.8628158844765343
 so I'm not automatically making iron forever I kind of am but not on the new system at least and talks us up my dude until we actually upgrade to the new quarries,4040.52,4048.52,3.6091587389819324e-05,0.0,-0.13770429019270272,1.8628158844765343
 and I get enough power to run that forever I don't want to do that so iron ingots coming in we should get a little signpost for that,4048.52,4056.52,3.6091587389819324e-05,0.0,-0.13770429019270272,1.8628158844765343
 this is all good to go the next step though over here is going to be insiders so now we need to do this again but we need insiders so let me do charge,4056.52,4065.52,0.00014617855777032673,0.0,-0.13311800463446255,1.8235294117647058
 let me rotate put that here is that right nope,4065.52,4069.52,0.00014617855777032673,0.0,-0.13311800463446255,1.8235294117647058
 okay so this is insiders and insiders are going to be a little wacky I think they require me to have a gear a basic control circuit and a plate,4069.52,4085.52,0.00014617855777032673,0.0,-0.13311800463446255,1.8235294117647058
 so we should do the plate and the gear the same way I did on the other side then so we should do that right here I feel if we can,4085.52,4093.52,0.00014205998741090298,0.0,-0.16521493215409536,1.607843137254902
 but this is going to touch so maybe we should move it over slightly,4093.52,4096.52,0.00014205998741090298,0.0,-0.16521493215409536,1.607843137254902
 this requires four inputs I got to use all these,4102.52,4105.52,0.00014205998741090298,0.0,-0.16521493215409536,1.607843137254902
 but I think two of them can be lost I think that's fine,4105.52,4114.52,3.825437306659296e-05,0.0,-0.15408826485658303,1.4204545454545454
 I need a gear in a plate so I could do this as a gear in a plate here,4117.52,4124.52,3.825437306659296e-05,0.0,-0.15408826485658303,1.4204545454545454
 many more like we can do a gear here a plate there and then if I want to make a gear we already know how to do that and if I want to make a plate it's going to work the same way,4124.52,4140.52,6.117608427302912e-05,0.0,-0.1289081359177493,1.8109452736318408
 and I know what you're saying like why aren't you using the old like plate formers or whatever are you probably thinking that it's because they aren't very nice to automate in my opinion,4140.52,4149.52,6.117608427302912e-05,0.0,-0.1289081359177493,1.8109452736318408
 even though this is twice as many materials it's not going to matter in the end it really isn't I don't know,4149.52,4154.52,0.00012118167069274932,0.0,-0.23784355568674814,1.7935222672064777
 uh crown what's it might do things in three months and to the topic I think if I have to find my men,4154.52,4159.52,0.00012118167069274932,0.0,-0.23784355568674814,1.7935222672064777
 yeah I'm the insider will go somewhere and I can use the other three sides,4160.52,4165.52,0.00012118167069274932,0.0,-0.23784355568674814,1.7935222672064777
 so I'm thinking we do two things are ironed here and then like maybe we do the insider here and then like we even put that I need to break these down I forgot,4165.52,4174.52,0.00012118167069274932,0.0,-0.23784355568674814,1.7935222672064777
 these on when you build them with the tool or whatever it's called the utility capsule,4174.52,4182.52,0.0001568897714605555,0.0,-0.2392103455283425,1.5
 it just doesn't see them as like normal inputs which is really bizarre,4182.52,4187.52,0.0001568897714605555,0.0,-0.2392103455283425,1.5
 oh shit I don't know Steve French what's up my day looking back three months my man input and then output here,4187.52,4195.52,0.0001568897714605555,0.0,-0.2392103455283425,1.5
 okay,4195.52,4198.52,0.0001568897714605555,0.0,-0.2392103455283425,1.5
 basically everyone that short of crypto got fucked I don't know I mean sure what's what happens to the market goes up and they think it's going down same for anything though,4198.52,4210.52,0.00015554965648334473,0.0,-0.32877173513736363,1.5241379310344827

 well let's let's see what else I need here I think it's that I need a sheet metal right,4226.52,4233.52,8.067736780503765e-05,0.0,-0.18292115415845597,1.5737704918032787
 I need steel sheet metal let's make a few of those one two three oh that's too many holy shit,4233.52,4239.52,8.067736780503765e-05,0.0,-0.18292115415845597,1.5737704918032787
 iron plate let's do one two three four put this back all right good all right boom boom boom oh kidding I did the math man and I'm almost really to take the bet by the way,4239.52,4253.52,2.0413192032719962e-05,0.0,-0.18456506729125977,1.6224489795918366
 but you're talking about so this is something I've been trying to learn a lot more on right about like when you say Ethereum is going to go to 10k,4253.52,4264.52,2.0413192032719962e-05,0.0,-0.18456506729125977,1.6224489795918366
 this website's fucking beautiful if a theorem would really go to 10k right that would be that would make it have a $1 trillion market cap,4264.52,4277.52,1.1942325727432035e-05,0.0,-0.1285468916739187,1.5240963855421688
 I don't know if I really believe that Ethereum is going to go to one trillion at the end of the year man to be fair,4277.52,4287.52,1.1942325727432035e-05,0.0,-0.1285468916739187,1.5240963855421688
 now it would need like that's such a massive gain that's like that's larger than Bitcoin right now I don't really see Ethereum doing that in one year maybe in like five years but that's that's a lot like that's a fuck ton,4287.52,4302.52,5.828439680044539e-05,0.0,-0.18199808457318475,1.7791666666666666
 let me see here okay I'm making capsules okay good and then I need to get small energy input hatches okay do I have any machine blocks I have to have more of these right I still think I need more than that,4302.52,4315.52,5.828439680044539e-05,0.0,-0.18199808457318475,1.7791666666666666
 yeah GME stalks 100k end of the month listen anyone actually doing that anyone actually in GME I think I need three of those that's good I'm missing one more thing right no I do tiny item inputs,4315.52,4341.52,4.11856708524283e-05,0.0,-0.3363172610600789,1.4370370370370371

 USD printing like water in the ocean of water so believe it truly means something I mean it does dude it truly has a lot of money there's like even though we're printing like a few trillion a year,4355.52,4372.52,4.0735005313763395e-05,0.0,-0.1687610149383545,1.6208530805687205
 like I think the house just approved the like $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill or whatever it still has to pass a Senate but like that's a lot man,4372.52,4381.52,4.0735005313763395e-05,0.0,-0.1687610149383545,1.6208530805687205
 I actually think I should move this back one shouldn't I put this here boy got it here wait this is the wrong direction,4381.52,4401.52,0.00015920886653475463,0.0,-0.21176768993509226,1.3076923076923077
 okay so this needs to be plates I think so if I want to make plates right cuz we're trying to make this which requires this which is pretend it's not,4401.52,4421.52,6.282663525780663e-05,0.0,-0.14123728468611435,1.3925233644859814
 I don't use our plates use our plates oh you can only use a basic assembler interesting okay,4421.52,4435.52,6.945872155483812e-05,0.0,-0.3166259996818774,1.5471698113207548
 buying 3090s the mine right now is a good idea it's not true 3090s are kind of buying 3060 TI's are good 3090s have a notorious heat issues right now you,4435.52,4443.52,6.945872155483812e-05,0.0,-0.3166259996818774,1.5471698113207548
 have to like modify them which is really fucking annoying you don't like replace the thermal pads and I'm just stupid okay I need to I think I guess we'll just do that right,4443.52,4453.52,8.350647840416059e-05,0.0,-0.1667543649673462,1.5096774193548388

 okay how do I make this what that's so expensive for a basic assembler I mean I make it once night don't need to make it again so it's too machine,4467.52,4475.52,3.342091804370284e-05,0.0,-0.19454027477063632,1.5857142857142856

 bog bog bog bog also need a tiny item input and machine circuitry good about 8 3060s that be smart no not 3060s a 3060 TI they crippled the 3060 got a 3080 FD this Saturday,4507.52,4531.52,3.089577512582764e-05,0.0,-0.3106378936767578,1.323076923076923
 made how nicely presented the boxes don't want to mine with it I know the 3080s actually like beautifully packaged 3090s the whole of 30 series honestly looks really good coming out of the box,4531.52,4541.52,6.0818507336080074e-05,0.0,-0.22388976270502264,1.3617021276595744
 man okay I need to pick this up so pick that up because we know I actually don't want to do that there I'm going to put this here though I think I can put that there it'll go there,4541.52,4569.52,6.8242711677157786e-06,0.0,-0.1900229555495242,1.5126050420168067
 yeah let's do that I guess that what I want let me fix these again what is that the output that I need this,4569.52,4593.52,1.886575591925066e-05,0.0,-0.24404379417156352,1.3209876543209877
 okay good good and then I need this which I guess I'll put here which I'll put there I'll go boom boom okay good let's see I'll put,4593.52,4613.52,4.113844988751225e-05,0.0,-0.1268024831204801,1.4886363636363635
 again that input input input just bought my first car your paug decent car for the price of a 30 series GPU that is actually hilarious you can either buy a new car or a use car whatever are you,4613.52,4629.52,3.989325705333613e-05,0.0,-0.27566293080647786,1.4191176470588236
 buy a 30 series GPU make your choice oh god future man just wait to the 40 series cars when they're like fucking 10 grand you know how fast you make your money back you buy,4629.52,4647.52,2.200549715780653e-05,0.0,-0.25743996224752286,1.323076923076923
 60 series it doesn't matter how many you buy you have to if you buy eight of them you might eight times as fast but you have eight times the cost 30 60s I think ROI in three months right now but the difficulty curve is skyrocketing by the way I'm,4647.52,4661.52,3.5249791835667565e-05,0.0,-0.16000290672377784,1.7235772357723578
 making half of what I was making a month ago so that's just kind of what happens on the price goes up more people mine so it gets harder to mine so last month I was making about,4661.52,4671.52,3.5249791835667565e-05,0.0,-0.16000290672377784,1.7235772357723578
 1500 a month this month I'll be lucky lucky if I make you know what's funny actually I'm not really thinking and fiat I'm I used to be able to mine 1.5,4671.52,4681.52,7.986515993252397e-05,0.0,-0.19310324842279608,1.52803738317757
 Ethereum in a month now only mining point five ish the 1.5 was boosted because of the crazy spike but yeah what's happening with EIP 1559 it's going to be they're voting on it,4681.52,4691.52,7.986515993252397e-05,0.0,-0.19310324842279608,1.52803738317757
 this week but it's not included into the London hard fork and the London hard fork is into the week the mid summer so probably July and that's what will go in there might also add amendment EIP 696,4691.52,4703.52,0.00011720503243850544,0.0,-0.17449110878838434,1.6898148148148149
 which is going to make it so it like kills a six but I really don't see that going through we'll see I think I broke those let's go with that so that's going to be the,4703.52,4711.52,0.00011720503243850544,0.0,-0.17449110878838434,1.6898148148148149
 input we need input here and an input here for iron I think asic resistance yeah I don't there's too much money in a six I don't think a six but actually support it at all or,4711.52,4723.52,0.0001064515090547502,0.0,-0.20054766498034513,1.7362637362637363
 like want to support that a little do I want to connect this to this iron output I don't know if I do I feel like I should make them separate,4723.52,4731.52,0.0001064515090547502,0.0,-0.20054766498034513,1.7362637362637363
 I'm going to get it been just for now I think I'm going to make them separate I'm going to move this here as well just so I have them all like one spot,4731.52,4743.52,5.105059244669974e-05,0.0,-0.21314406093162827,1.6476683937823835
 how does asic resistance work it just changes the way the actual like bag file I think is generated because asics are like not really as adaptive as GPUs are it's the,4743.52,4753.52,5.105059244669974e-05,0.0,-0.21314406093162827,1.6476683937823835
 whole point of a GPU it's very adaptive but they're really really efficient at like unknown system if the system changes it basically cannot make a lot of them obsolete,4753.52,4761.52,1.745858389767818e-05,0.0,-0.12236021945351049,1.6076923076923078
 okay have you mind back what you spent the minor yes I arrived in three days surprisingly I because I didn't have to buy GPUs it was just a mother board,4761.52,4771.52,1.745858389767818e-05,0.0,-0.12236021945351049,1.6076923076923078
 let me see this is going to make the plates no gears well I could use a basic assembler for this,4771.52,4779.52,1.745858389767818e-05,0.0,-0.12236021945351049,1.6076923076923078
 standard assembler faster though okay so I need a gear mold and I'm going to put the gear mold in here I just put it here because why not,4779.52,4789.52,5.189473813516088e-05,0.0,-0.2709942751152571,1.8021390374331552
 and then this I need to make plates and that needs a plate mold wait wait wait that needs that that needs this,4789.52,4797.52,5.189473813516088e-05,0.0,-0.2709942751152571,1.8021390374331552
 so yeah I need to plate molder fast POP I would somebody do welcome back 47 months man I heard I heard from a little bit let's see plate mold okay I didn't work so let's make,4797.52,4817.52,2.571838558651507e-05,0.0,-0.359202882517939,1.3700787401574803
 plate mold let's see what we got here I need a nugget this here,4817.52,4827.52,1.5811041521374136e-05,0.0,-0.25257258415222167,1.0
 okay yeah I don't think EIP 6969 will pass if I had a guess it's there's too much money invested in the A6 for it to even think about passing in my opinion technically the,4827.52,4853.52,4.4410451664589345e-05,0.0,-0.283257069795028,1.2857142857142858
 devs can do what they want but like you don't want to piss off your miners because the miners literally run the whole pool so okay do you think crypto falls one or two more times no I think crypto is going to fall like 100 to 1000 like a million more time what it's a,4853.52,4867.52,6.402777216862887e-05,0.0,-0.18917888507508396,1.7357142857142858
 normal market it's going to go up and down if you if you're talking about corrections in 2017 there was like 7 30% corrections before it actually hit the max of 19 K from like 3 K where it started we've had I guess two,4867.52,4882.52,6.402777216862887e-05,0.0,-0.18917888507508396,1.7357142857142858
 corrections now in this bull cycle for about 30% I think one was about 27% it almost about 32% something like that all right it's not predictable I don't know it's just you can you can use the history but it's not super predicted,4882.52,4899.52,7.975372864166275e-05,0.0,-0.25064811706542967,1.4967320261437909
 I okay so we have plates here our gears here and we have plates there that'll make us gears and plates which we're going to put filters actually we don't even need to filter this if I separate that that's all basically perfect,4899.52,4913.52,0.00010970837320201099,0.0,-0.24922743030622893,1.6142857142857143
 so we'll that'll go there that'll go here the only other thing I need if I'm trying to make insiders is circuits and circuits require an assembler with plates copper wire that's not right yeah actually plates can copper wire so I can make plates from here,4913.52,4931.52,2.4700229914742522e-05,0.0,-0.18046809887063914,1.7
 right and send them to this machine as well so let's do that I guess mother fucker I didn't mean to do that,4931.52,4946.52,5.336617323337123e-05,0.0,-0.12740584985533757,1.569767441860465
 and I'm pretty sure that deleted all the stuff inside of it right yeah I always forget what to do I need to charge it with this is missing item inputs god damn it,4946.52,4958.52,5.336617323337123e-05,0.0,-0.12740584985533757,1.569767441860465

 okay and then I think I just need conveyors yeah controls the controls yeah wish it worked that way man,4978.52,4989.52,4.830868783756159e-05,0.0,-0.34087386661105684,1.44
 it's two 12 of these perfect you need to set my things to the four month man,4989.52,5001.52,4.830868783756159e-05,0.0,-0.34087386661105684,1.44

 so that'll be the input this will be an input as well so that's going to be plates going in we need copper wires and then we also need redstone,5021.52,5038.52,6.272297468967736e-05,0.0,-0.08844587609574601,1.5052631578947369
 so I think I can do redstone here in a bin and then I can do copper wires over here and copper wires again I'm going to make through a machine which is going to be a standard assembler,5038.52,5058.52,7.2249235927301925e-06,0.0,-0.08897800030915634,1.5206611570247934
 so we just need one more standard assembler I need two item inputs and I'm going to put this here I think yeah I'll make sure I break it all don't worry,5058.52,5078.52,2.3307564333663322e-05,0.0,-0.09166271686553955,1.345132743362832
 okay one more bin I got to break the inputs now this should work I play Valheim this weekend I barely know what date is right now I got sucked into the game,5078.52,5090.52,3.942794864997268e-05,0.0,-0.15789669752120972,1.630057803468208

 yeah iron iron copper and then redstones over there redstone it barely uses it so I can just kind of run it for a while let's let's go ahead and delete all the inputs and put them all back that way it actually works I know it's a little silly but like I just feels like a glitch that doesn't work,5099.52,5116.52,3.4552715078461915e-05,0.0,-0.12066951452517043,1.7603305785123966
 like a weird glitch to like for some reason it needs a bud on all them or a block update sorry I'll put okay good same thing here,5116.52,5128.52,3.4552715078461915e-05,0.0,-0.12066951452517043,1.7603305785123966
 I'll put input input input input input,5128.52,5134.52,0.00013309360656421632,0.0,-0.3559517463048299,1.8095238095238095
 okay did I do all these,5134.52,5158.52,1.218418765347451e-05,0.2,-0.3629377603530884,0.7419354838709677
 okay so this is going to make circuits we're going to put a circuit in there,5158.52,5182.52,5.3432526328833774e-05,0.0,-0.21592830476306735,1.1343283582089552
 this is going to make inserters correct so I'm going to put an inserter in here,5182.52,5192.52,6.274402403505519e-05,0.0,-0.2118453772171684,1.4310344827586208
 should output there this here I think I've already have set up a little bit yes and no,5192.52,5206.52,6.274402403505519e-05,0.0,-0.2118453772171684,1.4310344827586208
 I don't think that's supposed to be like that yeah that's correct okay that way these systems are technically,5206.52,5216.52,3.0771916499361396e-05,0.0,-0.1735980063676834,1.8050314465408805
 technically separated so this will make plates this here is going to make it's going iron going in and where is that going to that's going over there I think that's making gears,5216.52,5232.52,3.0771916499361396e-05,0.0,-0.1735980063676834,1.8050314465408805
 if that's the case I need another gear mold wait is it I think so yeah hold on let me get a gear mold,5232.52,5242.52,7.212958007585257e-05,0.0,-0.2370248663014379,1.216867469879518
 that's not a gear mold whereas the gear mold how do you make a gear mold,5242.52,5256.52,7.687052857363597e-05,0.0,-0.20554721923101515,1.2
 don't worry I'm going to get this working that I'm going to forget how it works that's typically how these things go like it makes sense for now but does it always,5256.52,5273.52,7.565597115899436e-06,0.0,-0.24172718524932862,1.4553571428571428
 all right so this makes the inserter this makes the actual circuit the circuit requires copper wire redstone plate we have the thing here this is going to be the plate I believe no,5273.52,5298.52,4.7909936256473884e-05,0.0,-0.1629547119140625,1.565217391304348
 that's going to be the wire yeah this is going to be the wire so let me go get a wire thing or fast too we forgot everything it's a little confusing yeah I built it now is like I'm sure it makes sense when I'm going through it it's kind of not right now,5303.52,5320.52,0.02499536983668804,0.0,-0.22644460201263428,1.6644736842105263
 wire mold pod so yeah copper goes in the here it makes a wire wire goes in the here and we need wire redstone and iron plates,5320.52,5349.52,5.92421019973699e-06,0.0,-0.15940259397029877,1.4534883720930232
 so that means this is going to make iron plates such but the iron plate thing here but I thought this was also making iron plates which is the weird part,5349.52,5366.52,0.00012261365191079676,0.0,-0.12342967987060546,1.53
 that's definitely a problem let's just assume that's going to make iron plates and then over here for the actual inserters I need iron plates iron gears and basic circuits so basic circuits iron plates and then this technically is going to be iron gears,5366.52,5387.52,2.038173988694325e-06,0.0,-0.1403044934542674,1.7816901408450705
 okay so then this is iron gears this over here one of these doing iron gears one of these doing iron plates and then the other ones doing not this one right sorry this is doing iron plates,5396.52,5414.52,0.21018680930137634,0.0,-0.1495607126326788,1.9183673469387754
 oh okay I think I see the problem so this is making conveyor belts but conveyor belts need two things oh no this is actually correct isn't it yes totally is I'm thinking about it now it's all good to go,5414.52,5432.52,0.00014386144175659865,0.0,-0.11622097969055176,1.5419847328244274
 so conveyor belts they're actually easier than I thought so in the normal assembler or standard assembler they just require a belt already and then an iron gear and an iron ingot so this is making iron gears here and that's the iron ingot so yeah everything works out perfectly,5432.52,5451.52,2.674250936252065e-05,0.0,-0.18589501302750383,1.6686746987951808
 okay the only thing is we do want we do need an actual conveyor belt in here so it knows what the hell is making and then that means conveyor belt goes there that means a inserter goes here and then out of here goes the green potion but we need a green potion in here so it knows what the hell is making too,5451.52,5468.52,3.838441625703126e-05,0.0,-0.12557649149478062,2.1576354679802954
 so let's do that and then with that we make the actual research research comes out of here and in here okay I'm going to need like,5468.52,5480.52,3.838441625703126e-05,0.0,-0.12557649149478062,2.1576354679802954
 fucking like 15 servos basically minimum punk geek welcome back my man good to see you I have seven servos so far I'm going to start with the easy part basically back here,5480.52,5496.52,0.00011718583846231923,0.0,-0.15183831453323365,1.3571428571428572
 yeah we need so many more they all they all record and serders as well for make these so,5496.52,5507.52,7.253495277836919e-05,0.0,-0.35773128933376735,1.5294117647058822
 ah boom boom boom boom boom you have the assemblers backwards I'm 99% sure I don't unless you mean a single one of them,5507.52,5521.52,7.253495277836919e-05,0.0,-0.35773128933376735,1.5294117647058822
 I'm very certain I don't you swap gears and plates I'll double check I don't think I did,5521.52,5532.52,0.00011627971980487928,0.0,-0.09593369410588191,1.1
 gears and plates are swapped I don't think they are I know I might have originally made this for one thing but it doesn't really matter at this point,5532.52,5551.52,7.084833487169817e-05,0.0,-0.1336421694074358,1.3669724770642202
 this right here right I need gears and plates in the here I have plates here because I also need plates for the circuits so I should be going into this machine and in this machine,5551.52,5564.52,2.8991054932703264e-05,0.0,-0.13866452247865738,1.9642857142857142
 and then this is going to be gears right and then I have gears being made here going into there,5564.52,5572.52,2.8991054932703264e-05,0.0,-0.13866452247865738,1.9642857142857142
 the big assembler cannot make plates you sure about that,5572.52,5582.52,2.2113490558695048e-05,0.0,-0.1429371057554733,1.4198473282442747
 okay hold on you are right but this makes things complicated now because this doesn't just fix stuff now it's even more fucked up,5585.52,5599.52,2.2113490558695048e-05,0.0,-0.1429371057554733,1.4198473282442747
 so I have gears here and I have I sorry I have plates here and I have gears here I need plates they go into here but I also need plates they go into there,5599.52,5609.52,0.00011141456343466416,0.0,-0.13694414774576824,2.0588235294117645
 and I have gears here and I only want gears to go there so we can fix this if we filter it if we just specify what goes where filtering it should work perfectly,5609.52,5622.52,0.00011141456343466416,0.0,-0.13694414774576824,2.0588235294117645
 and that way I don't have to like move stuff because moving stuff is a big pain we don't have any more filters so we have to make more filters,5622.52,5631.52,9.584407234797254e-05,0.0,-0.2335922522623031,1.7254901960784315
 the problem with making filters is the required routers which are expensive because I don't actually have any of this too,5631.52,5637.52,9.584407234797254e-05,0.0,-0.2335922522623031,1.7254901960784315

 It's working perfectly. And this is going to be the output.,6193.84,6200.84,5.6171833421103656e-05,0.0,-0.21998844146728516,1.5310344827586206

 And then it will fill up this as a buffer and then fill the rest up as a buffer and stop.,6259.84,6262.84,5.118363333167508e-05,0.0,-0.10093340380438443,1.9553903345724908

 Yeah so there it fogs up but pretty quickly it goes back down.,12440.4,12448.4,7.609142630826682e-05,0.0,-0.17417483494199557,1.6414141414141414
 I wonder I wonder what the temperature like obviously makes a big difference so I wonder if that would play a like how big of a difference.,12448.4,12454.4,7.609142630826682e-05,0.0,-0.17417483494199557,1.6414141414141414
 I'm gonna play around with how this fits because right now it's just kind of.,12454.4,12460.4,6.502317410195246e-05,0.0,-0.3213569735303337,1.4943181818181819
 I'm just gonna do that.,12460.4,12462.4,6.502317410195246e-05,0.0,-0.3213569735303337,1.4943181818181819

 That's a little better a little more comfortable.,12465.4,12470.4,6.502317410195246e-05,0.0,-0.3213569735303337,1.4943181818181819
 I mean.,12470.4,12477.4,6.502317410195246e-05,0.0,-0.3213569735303337,1.4943181818181819

 It needs to be like a strap or something for a man.,12478.4,12480.4,6.502317410195246e-05,0.0,-0.3213569735303337,1.4943181818181819
 I'm gonna use a change strap but like I don't know something.,12480.4,12484.4,4.138538133702241e-05,0.0,-0.39179342220991087,1.4228571428571428

 So I guess let's see here.,12490.4,12493.4,4.138538133702241e-05,0.0,-0.39179342220991087,1.4228571428571428

 It's not bad.,12525.4,12539.4,7.734374958090484e-05,0.0,-0.22850014368693033,1.170731707317073
 I'm trying to think about where this would be the best the best use case for this.,12539.4,12548.4,7.734374958090484e-05,0.0,-0.22850014368693033,1.170731707317073
 Oh my god there's even a worse one hold on.,12548.4,12558.4,3.1144874810706824e-05,0.0,-0.2594046372633714,1.3333333333333333
 Oh my god you can't see anything.,12558.4,12561.4,3.1144874810706824e-05,0.0,-0.2594046372633714,1.3333333333333333
 Wait.,12561.4,12564.4,3.1144874810706824e-05,0.0,-0.2594046372633714,1.3333333333333333
 Okay it's so much worse.,12564.4,12569.4,3.1144874810706824e-05,0.0,-0.2594046372633714,1.3333333333333333
 So yeah.,12569.4,12571.4,3.1144874810706824e-05,0.0,-0.2594046372633714,1.3333333333333333
 It's bugged up.,12571.4,12574.4,3.1144874810706824e-05,0.0,-0.2594046372633714,1.3333333333333333
 Hard to say there's a way around that.,12574.4,12577.4,3.1144874810706824e-05,0.0,-0.2594046372633714,1.3333333333333333
 Okay I don't know how true this should be.,12577.4,12580.4,0.00036561660817824304,0.0,-0.1929277714675035,1.8235294117647058
 Aren't there very special coatings you could use and know this actually is a thing.,12580.4,12584.4,0.00036561660817824304,0.0,-0.1929277714675035,1.8235294117647058
 So on my motorcycle I have my motorcycle helmet.,12584.4,12587.4,0.00036561660817824304,0.0,-0.1929277714675035,1.8235294117647058
 I have a very special like system that you're supposed to apply to it when it's cold.,12587.4,12593.4,0.00036561660817824304,0.0,-0.1929277714675035,1.8235294117647058
 Because you will absolutely fog up your motorcycle helmet with it's like in cold weather or whatever right.,12593.4,12597.4,0.00036561660817824304,0.0,-0.1929277714675035,1.8235294117647058
 There was like a specific I don't know if it's like hydrophobic or like what but there's some sort of special coating you use.,12597.4,12602.4,0.00036561660817824304,0.0,-0.1929277714675035,1.8235294117647058
 And there's like an insert I put on my actual visor that makes it so it can't fog up from your actual yeah pinlock that's it.,12602.4,12610.4,3.265819759690203e-05,0.0,-0.1688806387094351,1.8275862068965518
 I would I don't know if pinlock is just like the name of it or whatever but basically it's like an antifog chemical that's on your actual visor so it doesn't actually do that.,12610.4,12620.4,3.265819759690203e-05,0.0,-0.1688806387094351,1.8275862068965518
 So I'm surprised they didn't make a system like this like that for this because kind of station has to be the most like annoying thing with this whole set because you have like your own like a little atmosphere that you've made.,12620.4,12631.4,3.265819759690203e-05,0.0,-0.1688806387094351,1.8275862068965518
 So I don't know bro some of these are so ridiculous hold on uh order and some you another one so look at visor.,12631.4,12638.4,6.028283678460866e-05,0.0,-0.4679003765708522,1.2285714285714286

 The dark night rises to right. Oh is it in New York is it. I thought it was an LA.,12668.4,12675.4,2.5642913897172548e-05,0.0,-0.3193647464116414,1.2542372881355932
 I've actually worked in this it's not bad.,12675.4,12686.4,2.5642913897172548e-05,0.0,-0.3193647464116414,1.2542372881355932
 What the fuck is that.,12686.4,12690.4,2.5642913897172548e-05,0.0,-0.3193647464116414,1.2542372881355932
 Hold on these are so crazy I never knew this thing Jamie what's that then today we have something so.,12690.4,12699.4,9.600195335224271e-05,0.0,-0.22098582131522043,1.4965986394557824
 Is anyone getting like massive JP vibes from this like this style of a room with like a scooter.,12699.4,12707.4,9.600195335224271e-05,0.0,-0.22098582131522043,1.4965986394557824
 I'm getting JP vibes.,12707.4,12709.4,9.600195335224271e-05,0.0,-0.22098582131522043,1.4965986394557824
 I saw images of this thing on the internet and I was like we got to get it that's too crazy the product is called bio visor the company visor visor tech.,12709.4,12721.4,7.585762796225026e-05,0.0,-0.20034427642822267,1.5520833333333333
 Your personal air purifying shield this thing you wear and you look like you're ready for any environment including Mars you definitely are not.,12721.4,12732.4,7.585762796225026e-05,0.0,-0.20034427642822267,1.5520833333333333
 Get in here that's a little posh you know what's up there inside of this pocket is like a glove.,12732.4,12739.4,2.4861203200998716e-05,0.0,-0.22735295670755792,1.736040609137056
 There are sections for these kind of inside gloves so you can bring your hands into the visor I guess if you need to it's your face so this is like a soft touch it's a little bit rubbery this is one of the filters I guess on the top it's a clip.,12739.4,12758.4,2.4861203200998716e-05,0.0,-0.22735295670755792,1.736040609137056
 A little pass through that there this is the bigger filter back here and you can see the fan on the inside of there as well.,12758.4,12770.4,7.656068191863596e-05,0.0,-0.21638021204206678,1.32

 Oh wow check that out so on the intake you see how it roots the air up to the top all the cables come out to the front for power so now we have the fan controller power this feel this feels so weird as a product I feel well this is about to be quite the experience.,12777.4,12804.4,1.7460104572819546e-05,0.0,-0.16322334229000032,1.6358024691358024
 Oh my god it looks so ridiculous.,12804.4,12808.4,0.0001759557198965922,0.0,-0.2312310324774848,1.5981735159817352
 Why is it so tall I don't know right.,12808.4,12811.4,0.0001759557198965922,0.0,-0.2312310324774848,1.5981735159817352
 Oh man okay so I hope you guys can hear me it has these little hand sections over here these little gloves that you can actually sort of put on like this and it's your face or remove an air pod or it makes you a little bit less claustrophobic somehow you don't want to use them.,12811.4,12832.4,0.0001759557198965922,0.0,-0.2312310324774848,1.5981735159817352
 You just simply zip that section.,12832.4,12835.4,3.765735891647637e-05,0.0,-0.14366834591596556,1.5668449197860963
 It does feel a little bit humid we're going up to a level one right now.,12835.4,12840.4,3.765735891647637e-05,0.0,-0.14366834591596556,1.5668449197860963
 What's that mean let's try level two.,12840.4,12845.4,3.765735891647637e-05,0.0,-0.14366834591596556,1.5668449197860963
 And I'm going to go all the way up to a level three now this is obviously a very extreme version of protection that is not going to be for everyone.,12845.4,12857.4,3.765735891647637e-05,0.0,-0.14366834591596556,1.5668449197860963
 Is this a positive pressure system or what am I understanding this wrong like where is the air actually exit the whole system is it through the top maybe.,12857.4,12865.4,3.094649946433492e-05,0.0,-0.12004544801801165,1.849624060150376
 But maybe it's some kind of a glimpse into the future way in which humans are a really good way to do this by the way would be like a like a paper system where it's a positive pressure system so essentially there's no air flowing in that doesn't go through the filter it's not possible because it's higher pressure than the outside area.,12865.4,12885.4,3.094649946433492e-05,0.0,-0.12004544801801165,1.849624060150376
 Protect themselves it could be I don't know we've all seen the science fiction obviously for most of you watching this this thing seems absolutely insane.,12885.4,12895.4,0.00040628155693411827,0.0,-0.2180508989276308,1.2941176470588236

 Backman hold on there's um there's one more isn't there what the fuck plastic off-gassing it might but I don't know that's so weird I still feel like this would be the like if I had a wear something like it's kind of crazy is that I feel like this would definitely be what it end up using where's,12925.4,12947.4,0.00016173372569028288,0.0,-0.24462828765044342,1.6444444444444444
 it I just want to watch like a review for it.,12947.4,12957.4,2.9887802156736143e-05,0.0,-0.23349185423417526,1.3135593220338984
" Sure, we'll watch this review like this looks so much more normal I feel even though it's a lot on your face.",12957.4,12969.4,2.9887802156736143e-05,0.0,-0.23349185423417526,1.3135593220338984
 I don't know. It's actually not that bad of talk through as I thought let's kind of loud those.,12969.4,12981.4,8.014011837076396e-05,0.0,-0.26204693701959425,1.6457399103139014

 The biggest issue with this is the fact that you can see it's already tugging on their ears pretty heavily I feel like if it had a strap that connected you know I'm talking about like one of the ones that goes in the full back of your head.,12985.4,12996.4,8.014011837076396e-05,0.0,-0.26204693701959425,1.6457399103139014
 So it's like it's like two things here that come down in that connect I feel like that would be way better because that way you're not putting any pressure on your ears and you could wear it for like in the whole point of this seems like it's supposed to be a lot more comfortable this things like 126 grams that's not too bad.,12996.4,13012.4,0.00011474904022179544,0.0,-0.20454329094000623,1.7471698113207548

 Like it's basically you you you can do that yourself so you put the plastic hook strap like on the back of your head and then you attach these straps to that and tighten them and that pulls it off the back of your ears so it's not actually on it.,13021.4,13033.4,5.378721107263118e-05,0.0,-0.3242012472713695,1.7164948453608246

 Could you plug that in and then like to a battery pack and have it work or something like that. I'm betting maybe some things don't let you actually use it while charging like it doesn't work in parallel like that.,13134.4,13144.4,0.0002068650646833703,0.0,-0.18814055673007307,1.8365758754863812
 A good example is the iPad.

 What is it $14 a share right now.,13365.4,13379.4,6.470691732829437e-05,0.0,-0.40571566422780353,0.927536231884058
 Let's see that should be good.,13379.4,13384.4,6.470691732829437e-05,0.0,-0.40571566422780353,0.927536231884058
 Okay VACQ I should be a good little first purchase for this.,13384.4,13404.4,8.403177344007418e-05,0.0,-0.6467646548622533,0.9090909090909091
 I might put in more of this again we're probably not going to see much you see rock a lab doing a big rock and no that basically this is actually what we were just purchased.,13404.4,13414.4,9.103082993533462e-05,0.0,-0.31654207634203363,1.5511363636363635
 Hold on I close on my stuff so this right here is the holding company it's apparently it's called.,13414.4,13421.4,9.103082993533462e-05,0.0,-0.31654207634203363,1.5511363636363635
 So it's the ACQ and it's called an S. P. A. C. which is a special acquisition holding company.,13421.4,13434.4,2.3547620003228076e-05,0.0,-0.20582772590018608,1.5139664804469273
 This is the actual stock ticker that will transform into rocket labs if that makes sense.,13434.4,13440.4,2.3547620003228076e-05,0.0,-0.20582772590018608,1.5139664804469273
 So this ticker will transform into RKLB which will be rocket labs once they fully IPO.,13440.4,13446.4,2.3547620003228076e-05,0.0,-0.20582772590018608,1.5139664804469273
 So this is the announcement that they were going to be IPOing today and it kind of went up and then came back down so I think it's honestly like it's if you're interested in electron they're pretty much like the first.,13446.4,13460.4,0.00022750099014956504,0.0,-0.26591320627743437,1.642570281124498
 They're not the first I guess because S. P. C. E. is first but they're like the first privatized company for commercial like satellites not so much just like tourism like Virgin Galactic is.,13460.4,13473.4,0.00022750099014956504,0.0,-0.26591320627743437,1.642570281124498
 So this is the first time I've been to a company that's been to the C. E. and this will become RKLB if I understand that correctly.,13473.4,13481.4,0.00033559571602381766,0.2,-0.44719776680799034,1.7003484320557491
 So I really really want to support space I really and very bullish about space industries so I would like to get into it as early as possible.,13481.4,13488.4,0.00033559571602381766,0.2,-0.44719776680799034,1.7003484320557491
 So I absolutely want to purchase these as fast as I can.,13488.4,13493.4,0.00033559571602381766,0.2,-0.44719776680799034,1.7003484320557491
 This star link I'm trying to think of what else a few of this I think there's another company that might be IPOing at some point as well which will be neat.,13493.4,13501.4,0.00033559571602381766,0.2,-0.44719776680799034,1.7003484320557491
 So I'm going to get a little bit more of a bit more of the medium size satellites so if you want to send it if you if you want to send like a realistic satellite for like a large company this not going to be it.,13501.4,13512.4,0.00043324989383108914,0.2,-0.37631927837025037,1.8663366336633664
 But if you're trying to send like more of a consumer style satellite so for a smaller company maybe for a school stuff like that it basically is the perfect company.,13512.4,13522.4,0.00043324989383108914,0.2,-0.37631927837025037,1.8663366336633664
 So they're really starting to get the reusability down pretty well and soon to him when they actually catch their rocket which I think should be coming up soon.,13522.4,13531.4,4.800389433512464e-05,0.0,-0.1737989401205992,1.6073059360730593
 There'll be like almost fully reusable which is nuts.,13531.4,13535.4,4.800389433512464e-05,0.0,-0.1737989401205992,1.6073059360730593
 Yeah and they just announced today a project called neutron which is an eight ton rocket which is massive but it's a fucking huge rocket.,13535.4,13545.4,4.800389433512464e-05,0.0,-0.1737989401205992,1.6073059360730593
 So we'll see like I said I'm pretty sure space once it gets going in the next like 10 20 years is going to be a trillion dollar plus industry like no problem.,13545.4,13555.4,5.722426067222841e-05,0.0,-0.14319304148356118,1.5053191489361701
 It's going to be insane in my opinion.,13555.4,13558.4,5.722426067222841e-05,0.0,-0.14319304148356118,1.5053191489361701
 All right we still need more of these as waiting to see how many of us I have to use.,13558.4,13567.4,5.722426067222841e-05,0.0,-0.14319304148356118,1.5053191489361701
 I know I know I would I want Starlink as well but it's not worth the current monthly cost in my opinion.,13567.4,13582.4,3.3104897738667205e-05,0.0,-0.24800819050181996,1.4746835443037976
 What besides satellites is space can be used for basically the advancement of like the the the bleeding edge of tech my opinion.,13582.4,13592.4,3.3104897738667205e-05,0.0,-0.24800819050181996,1.4746835443037976
 The tech industry will probably be working towards the advancement of the human civilization which the next big step for that is going to be multi planetary species aka we need a large space station we need a large moon base.,13592.4,13604.4,0.000266681716311723,0.0,-0.1347814158389443,1.7591836734693878
 And eventually we need to go to Mars as well.,13604.4,13607.4,0.000266681716311723,0.0,-0.1347814158389443,1.7591836734693878
 And it's not like us it's not like a super hyper focus field like the advancements that we actually learn from going to space help earth and insane amount men.,13607.4,13618.4,0.000266681716311723,0.0,-0.1347814158389443,1.7591836734693878
 Like they really really do and it just it's beneficial to everyone essentially.,13618.4,13626.4,3.4735334338620305e-05,0.0,-0.19593709393551476,1.3653846153846154
 So yeah it will be a big thing it'll be a very very big thing.,13626.4,13638.4,3.4735334338620305e-05,0.0,-0.19593709393551476,1.3653846153846154
 And I think that's the opinion a lot of these space companies are going to be like larger I'm trying to think of them like this imagine like Amazon but if you're buying Amazon back in like the late 90 90s.,13638.4,13649.4,0.00023764139041304588,0.0,-0.25425159687898596,1.7705627705627707
 Right like that's kind of what I'm feeling like for most these space companies.,13649.4,13652.4,0.00023764139041304588,0.0,-0.25425159687898596,1.7705627705627707
 Like right now they're under baby steps but like we don't even understand the full scope of what they're going to be doing.,13652.4,13657.4,0.00023764139041304588,0.0,-0.25425159687898596,1.7705627705627707
 And like the shares I just bought for rocket labs might eventually like it depends on how crazy rocket labs goes but if it's one of the best providers for basically shuttling a satellite up the orbit for like the small to medium customers which is a market that they basically own right now like completely the big customers yeah it makes sense to go to the space section all but the medium customer small customers it's not realistic to go to those.,13657.4,13682.4,1.627018536964897e-05,0.0,-0.16695135572682257,1.836734693877551
 So it's cool diamond hands then crowd freeze yourself boom profit if I can just wake up in five years and look at my crypto account that be fucking amazing.,13682.4,13692.4,8.936680387705564e-05,0.0,-0.16616494876822246,1.630281690140845
 I say experiments is already a large chunk of our scientific advancements it's very cool actually there are some things that were like testing and space like certain medical stuff that you just you actually cannot even do on earth like you need microgravity for it to even be possible which is pretty sick.,13692.4,13708.4,8.936680387705564e-05,0.0,-0.16616494876822246,1.630281690140845
 So I'm curious. I'm not getting rid of these minor roots and longer need those.,13708.4,13717.4,0.00014733849093317986,0.0,-0.15990451563184507,1.6996336996336996
 But yeah this is one of those things right now though you really have to have faith in it and it really helps if you're optimistic about it is like a hobby right like I definitely feel like I'm like a space enthusiast it's much easier for me to put money into like I would say a sort of like long term slightly riskier investment just because I'm really like I really believe in them.,13717.4,13737.4,0.00014733849093317986,0.0,-0.15990451563184507,1.6996336996336996

 That easy movie was a documentary. That Matt Damon I think it was I use I use three different minors are now men but mainly it's Phoenix and to you ex.,13743.4,13759.4,0.0001037966285366565,0.0,-0.4236148385440602,1.3448275862068966
 Go back 10 years by as much basic when you can and go back boom stocks I mean sure right sure. Okay this is done.,13759.4,13769.4,0.00020322306954767555,0.0,-0.1977959306616532,1.5445544554455446
 I'm trying to think of what I need to do right now so we have a bunch of these batteries we could make more capacitors we should definitely do that and then we should make this start working I feel.,13769.4,13779.4,0.00020322306954767555,0.0,-0.1977959306616532,1.5445544554455446
 Okay I need iron plates and I need copper lead and maybe steel I don't remember so for batteries I need these.,13779.4,13789.4,3.527768421918154e-05,0.0,-0.11846251714797247,1.6336633663366336
 There's four.,13789.4,13792.4,3.527768421918154e-05,0.0,-0.11846251714797247,1.6336633663366336
 Okay there's two more.,13792.4,13794.4,3.527768421918154e-05,0.0,-0.11846251714797247,1.6336633663366336
 Every one of these we make is quite a bit more power we should do the math to figure out how many of these we actually need so we can figure out like the basic raw materials we need.,13794.4,13807.4,3.527768421918154e-05,0.0,-0.11846251714797247,1.6336633663366336
 Yeah I want to sleep in my gravity get pressure off my fucking spine.,13807.4,13811.4,6.296135688899085e-05,0.0,-0.23317580474050423,1.4827586206896552
 I'm not sure if that's like.,13811.4,13815.4,6.296135688899085e-05,0.0,-0.23317580474050423,1.4827586206896552
 Can the doctor like medically appoint you to go sleep in space I be kind of cool.,13815.4,13819.4,6.296135688899085e-05,0.0,-0.23317580474050423,1.4827586206896552
 So this is the output this is the.,13819.4,13822.4,6.296135688899085e-05,0.0,-0.23317580474050423,1.4827586206896552
 That's opposite blue is in.,13822.4,13825.4,6.296135688899085e-05,0.0,-0.23317580474050423,1.4827586206896552

 I want to go on the new shepherd have you seen that project from Blue Origin.,13842.4,13847.4,3.375971209607087e-05,0.0,-0.3891150951385498,1.1063829787234043
 We just essentially like a capsule that you go up in and you experience like a few minutes of being in space like you go past the carbon line which is like 100 kilometers up which is like basically when you're in space.,13847.4,13858.4,8.819138747639954e-05,0.0,-0.2383917767068614,1.8659420289855073
 You go up there for like a few minutes and they basically come back down it's really fucking cool.,13858.4,13862.4,8.819138747639954e-05,0.0,-0.2383917767068614,1.8659420289855073
 How much are for tick right now I one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven eleven so eleven thousand hour for tick in and out all the time and then technically I think we have like.,13862.4,13872.4,8.819138747639954e-05,0.0,-0.2383917767068614,1.8659420289855073
" 45,000 are for tick total so we need way more batteries so in total I would make 100 batteries I make a giant 10 by 10 wall or something so 100 batteries we already have 11 that's 89 more that we need.",13872.4,13885.4,2.2914595319889486e-05,0.0,-0.2309515380859375,1.5416666666666667
 But that means we need technically times two so I need 178 LV capacitors what am I looking at.,13885.4,13894.4,2.2914595319889486e-05,0.0,-0.2309515380859375,1.5416666666666667
 Field filled okay so yeah I need this.,13894.4,13903.4,2.969556771859061e-05,0.0,-0.2570003759665567,1.4698795180722892
 The battery wall could go in the basement I was thinking about the same thing to.,13903.4,13907.4,2.969556771859061e-05,0.0,-0.2570003759665567,1.4698795180722892
 So 170 to these times five that is 890 batteries each of those divide that by five because many buckets we need are we not.,13907.4,13917.4,2.969556771859061e-05,0.0,-0.2570003759665567,1.4698795180722892
 Would you 800 I'm gonna get a right this down would you 890 that's.,13917.4,13924.4,2.3985632651601918e-05,0.0,-0.43792365392049154,1.4066666666666667
" A lot and these each require 200 milla buckets and it requires one so I need 20 sulfur per 890 I think so time this by 20 I need 17,800 sulfur.",13924.4,13943.4,2.3985632651601918e-05,0.0,-0.43792365392049154,1.4066666666666667
 Oh my god so that's a system we got to make we have to make that passively there's no way that's happening anytime soon.,13943.4,13952.4,0.0001956194028025493,0.0,-0.15749845399961368,1.5974025974025974
" Holy shit 17,800 sulfur like this essentially this is what we need we need an absolute shit ton of gasoline.",13952.4,13961.4,0.0001956194028025493,0.0,-0.15749845399961368,1.5974025974025974
 So what we need to do is upgrade refinery we just unlocked that earlier I think it's already off the charts right yeah we are to unlock it.,13961.4,13968.4,0.0001956194028025493,0.0,-0.15749845399961368,1.5974025974025974
 It's now time to make the advanced refinery and start going there we'll see.,13968.4,13973.4,4.608088420354761e-05,0.0,-0.15760026022652598,1.7258064516129032
 Oil is out and has no power oil is not out oil is actually still left in this tank but I do agree we do need to get power.,13973.4,13980.4,4.608088420354761e-05,0.0,-0.15760026022652598,1.7258064516129032
 So over here I was going to actually fix this once that ran out.,13980.4,13986.4,4.608088420354761e-05,0.0,-0.15760026022652598,1.7258064516129032
 Yeah so I'm thinking all the next all the next batteries we make should immediately go to flux ducks because we're going to need flux ducks for this in my opinion.,13986.4,13996.4,4.608088420354761e-05,0.0,-0.15760026022652598,1.7258064516129032
 Probably let me just double check this is all actually operating normally.,13996.4,14000.4,0.00022110852296464145,0.0,-0.1402018222403019,1.5315315315315314
 So I'm not sure if it is go there with that let's do this this and this.,14000.4,14006.4,0.00022110852296464145,0.0,-0.1402018222403019,1.5315315315315314
 Yeah maybe HV is also cheap like right now for solar we used four solar panels to make 10 times the power so it's like 2.5 times better.,14006.4,14014.4,0.00022110852296464145,0.0,-0.1402018222403019,1.5315315315315314
 I wonder if we can do the same.,14014.4,14016.4,0.00022110852296464145,0.0,-0.1402018222403019,1.5315315315315314

 They just gave you like the balls and like it was a normal ass table. It was like a professional snooker out haul like it was,17197.86,17203.62,5.4957974498393014e-05,0.0,-0.16172100850288443,1.890728476821192
 And all them played snooker by the way. It was a very asiany place because,17204.66,17207.46,5.4957974498393014e-05,0.0,-0.16172100850288443,1.890728476821192

 It's like when you uh you think you're good at smash you know back in the day when you're younger,17252.98,17256.26,0.00023007277923170477,0.0,-0.171608592524673,1.7628865979381443
 So you go to like a tournament and you just get your absolute shit kicked in because like you don't realize like,17256.34,17259.94,0.00023007277923170477,0.0,-0.171608592524673,1.7628865979381443

 Pull halls of the chillist. Well mine was nice because there was a noise policy,17264.66,17268.26,0.00013898822362534702,0.0,-0.23291503361293248,1.7702265372168284
 So they didn't want you to be loud,17268.34,17269.7,0.00013898822362534702,0.0,-0.23291503361293248,1.7702265372168284
 So like if you if there's a random bunch of scroop that's like drinking and being annoying,17269.7,17272.82,0.00013898822362534702,0.0,-0.23291503361293248,1.7702265372168284

 What do you call it?,17289.46,17290.66,0.00013898822362534702,0.0,-0.23291503361293248,1.7702265372168284
 Like ramen places they had a fah place like all in the strip. So basically all them had the menu in the actual store,17290.66,17296.82,5.800464714411646e-05,0.0,-0.17790756478214895,1.855421686746988
 And you can go to the actual,17296.9,17298.34,5.800464714411646e-05,0.0,-0.17790756478214895,1.855421686746988

 And they literally just call them up in order for you,17301.54,17303.78,5.800464714411646e-05,0.0,-0.17790756478214895,1.855421686746988
 And then they'd pay and you just basically be part of your bill. It was super awesome,17303.78,17307.62,5.800464714411646e-05,0.0,-0.17790756478214895,1.855421686746988
 Like I that's why I went there like every night for like four months straight. It was fucking great,17307.7,17311.38,5.800464714411646e-05,0.0,-0.17790756478214895,1.855421686746988
 But I moved away from it. So unfortunately I couldn't go there anymore because it was a little it was like a half an hour plus drive to get there,17313.38,17318.42,5.800464714411646e-05,0.0,-0.17790756478214895,1.855421686746988
 And then that was a bit too much the dude daily. So it used to just be like walk out of my apartment walk to the pool or the billiards,17318.42,17324.739999999998,5.498117388924584e-05,0.0,-0.1679766213715966,1.7209302325581395
 Or the snooker hall and then like do that every day. It was great. And it wasn't that expensive either right it was like maybe,17324.739999999998,17330.179999999997,5.498117388924584e-05,0.0,-0.1679766213715966,1.7209302325581395

 Which is on my opinion as a pretty decent price,17339.219999999998,17341.219999999998,5.498117388924584e-05,0.0,-0.1679766213715966,1.7209302325581395
 It's it's not bad. The thing is they don't really make money off you renting the pool table,17342.82,17346.579999999998,5.498117388924584e-05,0.0,-0.1679766213715966,1.7209302325581395

 Not too bad. Fun times you guys. I'm almost missed that now talking about it. That's good shit,17353.86,17357.7,8.621469896752387e-05,0.0,-0.1762065721594769,1.6356877323420074

 I'm thinking we maybe want to move these and we move into a more convenient location,17379.539999999997,17383.059999999998,3.3475778764113784e-05,0.0,-0.13692510371305505,1.732394366197183

 So maybe we move them here,17398.74,17402.260000000002,5.035521098761819e-05,0.0,-0.11421086940359562,1.6666666666666667

 Roll in the exact same way because it has to bounce off the wall and the wall is made of diamonds and they're really small kind of so they will roll everywhere,17909.62,17917.62,8.603071910329163e-05,0.0,-0.19481042605727467,1.810897435897436

 So this is going to output fluid that we need there that's going to output fluid we need there I need a server for both of these,19055.54,19063.06,9.073465480469167e-05,0.0,-0.1856462676803787,1.7530864197530864

 So how it's sulfur we just need water thing in one of these,19075.86,19079.940000000002,4.7733134124428034e-05,0.0,-0.24085430476976477,1.703883495145631

 Gasoline it needs water and lubricant lubricant needs walk to be they do only water,19085.3,19089.78,4.7733134124428034e-05,0.0,-0.24085430476976477,1.703883495145631

 Do this and then I just got to make the infinite water source,19100.100000000002,19103.7,4.7733134124428034e-05,0.0,-0.24085430476976477,1.703883495145631
 I guess anywhere I could leave it here for now,19103.7,19105.940000000002,5.102197974338196e-05,0.0,-0.2097449068163262,1.7105263157894737
 Don't know if there's any benefit to do that kind of want to put it right behind this thing,19107.22,19109.780000000002,5.102197974338196e-05,0.0,-0.2097449068163262,1.7105263157894737
 Like I need a pump right here and then that's going to be uh click click for output,19111.62,19117.86,5.102197974338196e-05,0.0,-0.2097449068163262,1.7105263157894737

 Isn't this cleaner like that like come on like look at what we have before and I look at this isn't that nice,19173.219999999998,19177.62,5.034348214394413e-05,0.0,-0.2488544782002767,1.3917525773195876
 Isn't that like I told you guys like I want to make this look good or I want and then I'll,19177.62,19181.94,7.856114098103717e-05,0.0,-0.16126041877560499,1.60752688172043
 Basically if I want to replicate this it's really simple to as well,19182.1,19184.579999999998,7.856114098103717e-05,0.0,-0.16126041877560499,1.60752688172043
 So I put one more down here and basically repeat this whole process,19184.82,19187.3,7.856114098103717e-05,0.0,-0.16126041877560499,1.60752688172043

 It's slick. It's looking good at the whole things modular too,19234.420000000002,19236.66,7.489567360607907e-05,0.0,-0.33760520686273987,1.3362068965517242

 But at some point we are but I like to make it so like it's really easy,19240.18,19243.78,5.1771552534773946e-05,0.0,-0.17094020354442108,1.6472868217054264

 I'll make a whole separate system to just basically build these like these modular build like you know setups,19247.54,19252.5,5.1771552534773946e-05,0.0,-0.17094020354442108,1.6472868217054264
 Which will look nice,19253.22,19255.22,5.1771552534773946e-05,0.0,-0.17094020354442108,1.6472868217054264

 Good I don't be got to do is this put one here,19258.1,19261.22,5.1771552534773946e-05,0.0,-0.17094020354442108,1.6472868217054264

 I'm gonna cover it so I don't have to worry about it um,19264.1,19266.1,2.47895823122235e-05,0.0,-0.23208366319971177,1.6796536796536796

 Can't forget that this does need power the best way to do this is probably go just over to one of the sides,19274.34,19278.899999999998,2.47895823122235e-05,0.0,-0.23208366319971177,1.6796536796536796
 Hmm maybe like right here,19284.019999999997,19286.019999999997,2.47895823122235e-05,0.0,-0.23208366319971177,1.6796536796536796
 So you're all boom boom boom this is the only thing that doesn't look that good in my opinion,19286.579999999998,19289.14,2.47895823122235e-05,0.0,-0.23208366319971177,1.6796536796536796

 You see there we go,19293.14,19295.14,6.475112604675815e-05,0.0,-0.30322052001953126,1.5263157894736843
 You get you won't really notice any of this,19296.1,19298.1,6.475112604675815e-05,0.0,-0.30322052001953126,1.5263157894736843

 Now we just got to get levers on each of these and output them directly to,19303.22,19306.42,6.475112604675815e-05,0.0,-0.30322052001953126,1.5263157894736843
 I'm pretty sure if we do this it should output directly to the machines,19306.98,19309.54,6.475112604675815e-05,0.0,-0.30322052001953126,1.5263157894736843
 Is that correct,19314.579999999998,19316.579999999998,6.475112604675815e-05,0.0,-0.30322052001953126,1.5263157894736843

 So the next thing we need to do is set up our oil input,19370.899999999998,19373.14,5.706907904823311e-05,0.0,-0.181995849609375,1.8065693430656935

 Because now that I know we don't have to go into the top of these things. It makes our basic way cleaner just to go into the bottom twice,19385.14,19389.7,5.65139162063133e-05,0.0,-0.12981258248383143,1.6704980842911878
 I'm thinking we replace that bin with something way larger,19393.22,19395.94,5.65139162063133e-05,0.0,-0.12981258248383143,1.6704980842911878

 The next k parameter there for cardano means that pool limit is 32 million coins,19405.859999999997,19409.379999999997,9.739157394506037e-05,0.0,-0.3310704417042918,1.5742574257425743

 So the close we get through to millions of that going over is how successful cardano pool,19412.42,19416.02,9.739157394506037e-05,0.0,-0.3310704417042918,1.5742574257425743

 Because at a certain point you get to the like you need to spend pretty much the entire day at the gym working out that specific,23991.7,23997.86,3.5322795156389475e-05,0.0,-0.1870463897134656,1.7656903765690377

 But typically it's much better if you focus on one,24002.34,24004.34,3.5322795156389475e-05,0.0,-0.1870463897134656,1.7656903765690377

 You know what this works though even though it's slow it doesn't matter,24015.46,24018.18,5.487414091476239e-05,0.0,-0.22126734415690105,1.481283422459893

 If a hopper is faster what we could do is do that into a hopper maybe self god damn it,24046.579999999998,24050.66,3.488850416033529e-05,0.0,-0.2715810976530376,1.5

 We don't even have an iron insert like a source of iron yet. So it's not really necessary,24060.74,24065.620000000003,1.961830821528565e-05,0.0,-0.15633042279411766,1.5707317073170732

 Let's try a hopper first see if it's faster,24073.940000000002,24075.940000000002,1.961830821528565e-05,0.0,-0.15633042279411766,1.5707317073170732

 Should deliver a stack into this yeah,24085.94,24089.859999999997,6.496917922049761e-05,0.0,-0.24789629311397157,1.1318681318681318

 Does anyone know if this fills up entirely actually let's find out,24113.62,24117.059999999998,0.00010372694669058546,0.0,-0.262363965394067,1.5126582278481013
 Does this stop working if this stops working to be great,24121.219999999998,24123.62,0.00010372694669058546,0.0,-0.262363965394067,1.5126582278481013
 Chikilans latest tweet is it about those coin I think I already saw it,24127.539999999997,24130.42,0.00010372694669058546,0.0,-0.262363965394067,1.5126582278481013
 But it just launches the items does it really,24130.42,24140.42,4.251899372320622e-05,0.0,-0.278169127071605,1.2017543859649122

 Is he talking about this do you think,24160.42,24162.42,2.323365151823964e-05,0.0,-0.21971161264768788,1.4855072463768115
 Or do you think,24166.02,24168.02,2.323365151823964e-05,0.0,-0.21971161264768788,1.4855072463768115
 Is it possible to know if let's say starlink has an s.p.a.c. right now,24168.579999999998,24172.899999999998,2.323365151823964e-05,0.0,-0.21971161264768788,1.4855072463768115
 Like can you keep your s.p.a.c. secret,24172.9,24180.34,7.378489681286737e-05,0.0,-0.22056901609742796,1.576271186440678
 Because what if starlink actually has an s.p.a.c. right now that'd be fucking ridiculous right,24184.9,24188.420000000002,7.378489681286737e-05,0.0,-0.22056901609742796,1.576271186440678
 Uh s.p.a.c. is a special acquisition company it basically is a shell company that will eventually become another company on the uh stock exchange,24194.34,24201.620000000003,7.378489681286737e-05,0.0,-0.22056901609742796,1.576271186440678
 So this right here V.A.C. Q is actually rocket labs rocket labs,24201.62,24206.02,1.8201499187853187e-05,0.0,-0.19525898419893706,1.7272727272727273

 So essentially this looks like a useless company called vector acquisition corporation,24211.86,24216.02,1.8201499187853187e-05,0.0,-0.19525898419893706,1.7272727272727273
 But this will become rocket labs. So if you own stock in this it will become rocket labs,24216.02,24220.5,1.8201499187853187e-05,0.0,-0.19525898419893706,1.7272727272727273
 The starlink goes public. I will literally go to the moon. It will starlink will become a billion dollar,24223.059999999998,24226.899999999998,1.8201499187853187e-05,0.0,-0.19525898419893706,1.7272727272727273

 Like a multi billion dollar company like in overnight,24229.06,24232.100000000002,3.474512050161138e-05,0.0,-0.17012744683485764,1.622568093385214
 Hmm if you want better control the input you could set the item filter some thermal uh to over send which sends them,24236.260000000002,24242.02,3.474512050161138e-05,0.0,-0.17012744683485764,1.622568093385214
 More I'm wondering if it's possible. You know what we should do,24242.58,24245.940000000002,3.474512050161138e-05,0.0,-0.17012744683485764,1.622568093385214
 Let's set up a redstone thing where if this chest is full it will turn this off,24246.74,24251.06,3.474512050161138e-05,0.0,-0.17012744683485764,1.622568093385214
 I'll I can't do that actually. I don't have um courts. Oh we can get courts though right from the bags,24251.620000000003,24255.86,3.474512050161138e-05,0.0,-0.17012744683485764,1.622568093385214

 I thought I was part of space x no starlink is its own company,24266.260000000002,24268.82,9.080334712052718e-05,0.0,-0.28420163349932936,1.4120879120879122

 So does anyone know is it even possible to do that?,24276.18,24278.34,9.080334712052718e-05,0.0,-0.28420163349932936,1.4120879120879122
 Like can you have an unknown s.p.a.c. Or is it more so,24278.98,24282.100000000002,9.080334712052718e-05,0.0,-0.28420163349932936,1.4120879120879122
 It's very well known what s.p.a.c.s are going to become,24282.1,24286.1,4.572663965518586e-05,0.0,-0.22563791275024414,1.1262135922330097

 Can't they just make s.p.a.c. not specifically and not specify what they'll stick in it. I assume yeah,24298.34,24313.46,0.00019004239584319293,0.0,-0.2059735824812704,1.4429530201342282

 And I didn't I don't have any even answers question how do people know that this is the s.p.a.c. that rocket labs is gonna use did they like officially announced that I assume,24326.42,24333.539999999997,4.7203702706610784e-05,0.0,-0.30559524959988066,1.5317073170731708
 What s.p.a.c rhymes with ham right yeah is there a list of s.p.a.c's?,24336.1,24340.739999999998,4.7203702706610784e-05,0.0,-0.30559524959988066,1.5317073170731708

 Starlink is a way to use lots of small cheap satellites to get in that connectivity a lot of people it's basically a new,24351.22,24357.300000000003,0.00011624651233432814,0.0,-0.2719416845412481,1.7222222222222223
